### Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## K SUPERMARKET SALES REPORT
### INTRODUCTION
As a data analyst at K Supermarket, I've been asked to deliver a sales report to the Senior Managers that details the company's sales, costs, profits, quantity sold, and historical performance across the nation.
I gave a summary of the sales statistics, emphasizing the trends and patterns, the main areas that needed improvement, and also making suggestions for the future sales tactics.
##### Tool UsedÂ : Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint and Power BI

### DATA VISUALIZATION & INSIGHTS
The insights obtained from the dataset are as follows:

The grocery store earned a profit of 3.88 million in 2013 and 13.02 million the following year. The business sold more than 264K products in 2013 and more than 861K in 2014. This is due to the growing number of customers and their rising spending power.

#### TOTAL COST BY PRODUCT
A quarter of the overall expenditure for 2013 was spent on the production of Velo, which cost 5.6 million dollars. The cost of manufacturing Paseo increased in 2014 and was roughly 23 million. This can be because of a rise in the number of products being produced and the rising cost of the raw materials used to make them.

#### PROFIT BY COUNTRY
Germany generated the most profit of 1.1 million and 2.6 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, according to a map visual of the income by countries. There was an 62% increase, which may have been brought on by the large number of shoppers in the supermarket. More specifically, it can be due to higher productivity and lower production costs for the goods in Germany.

Germany had the greatest sales in 2013 with 6.2 million, and they grew to 17 million in 2014. Nonetheless, the United States and Canada outperformed Germany in sales in 2014 with 20M, or 44% of all sales for that year. This may be due to the effective marketing techniques employed to draw in clients.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
* Countries with low profit margins should make every effort to reduce their expenses and reassess their strategies because a company's goal is to have enough profit at the end of the year.
* In addition to increasing sales, K Supermarket have to think about providing discounts at different seasons of the year.
